# ProjectE Plugin

- As you can see, I've converted the **ProjectE mod into a plugin**. This was neither simple nor overly complex.
- Currently, with the use of a resource pack, most features have been restored, except for **accessories** like **rings**.
- ~~That being said, maintaining this alone is quite difficult, so there won't be any updates in the near future qwq...~~
> Just kidding. Even though I say that, I'm still updating and maintaining it T_T

## ~~Click the bottom left corner to see the grand finale~~
## Click on the left sidebar to get started and see how to install this plugin.
